        <p>One of the major concepts that people miss when studying docker are processes. While a lot of people try to
            understand the difference between a container and a VM, a much more
            interesting question is what is the difference between a container and a process. To understand that first
            you need to understand what a process is, and that's what we are going to
            in this post.</p>
        <p class="my-4">Think about a regular day using a computer. You probably open several programs and just and just
            forget about what the computer is doing. What the computer is doing under the
            hoods is starting a new process for each program you start. That program itself can start other processes. Lets think
            about a browser, when you click on the firefox icon it sends a system
            call to the linux kernel that will initiate the chrome program. The command will start a new process and
            this is why the the usual definition of a process is <span class="italic">a program in execution</span>.
            This firefox process can or cannot start new processes that can initiate new processes by themselves, forming
            a tree of processes. Lets see how this works in a practical manner on the
            shell.</p>

        <p class="my-4">The <span class="italic">PID</span> is the process ID, the <span class="italic">PPID</span> is the parent process
            ID and the <span class="italic">Command</span> is the command that launched the process. If rou run the first command on Linux it will open Firefox and
            as you can see this process started several other process as its ID (7285) is the parent ID from the other processes. Now that we know how a process starts
            we have to understand what it does and what problem is it trying to solve.
