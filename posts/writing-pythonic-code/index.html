        If you like me started programming with a c-style language, like c, c++, c#, java, etc, you probably have a way to handle problems in
        code that resemble these languages. While this is not a problem, one of the best strengths of python is its readability and simplicity.
        Python provide several instruments, like using <span class="italic">range</span> function to iterate over for loops, list comprehension
        to generate lists instead of the traditional for loop approach, lambda functions, f-strings to improve string formatting, etc.
        So, what do I mean by pythonic code? From <a target="_black" class="underline" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25011078/what-does-pythonic-mean#:~:text=Loading%20when%20this%20answer%20was,is%20intended%20to%20be%20used.">

            Pythonic means code that doesn't just get the syntax right but that follows the conventions of the Python community and uses the language in the way it is intended to be used."
